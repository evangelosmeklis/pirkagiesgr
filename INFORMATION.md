- **Website**: https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/
- **Data Update Frequency**: Every 3-6 hours depending on satellite overpass
- **Global Coverage**: Worldwide fire detection and monitoring

### Satellite Instruments Used

#### MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)
- **Satellites**: Terra and Aqua
- **Resolution**: 1 km at nadir
- **Temporal Resolution**: 1-2 times daily
- **Spectral Bands**: 36 bands (visible to thermal infrared)
- **Fire Detection**: Uses thermal anomaly detection algorithms

#### VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite)
- **Satellites**: Suomi-NPP, NOAA-20, NOAA-21
- **Resolution**: 375m at nadir (I-bands), 750m (M-bands)
- **Temporal Resolution**: 1-2 times daily
- **Enhanced Features**: Improved spatial resolution over MODIS

### Fire Detection Methodology

#### Thermal Anomaly Detection
Fire detection relies on identifying thermal anomalies - areas significantly warmer than their surroundings. The algorithms compare:
- Brightness temperature at fire-sensitive wavelengths (3.9 Œºm, 11 Œºm)
- Background temperature of surrounding pixels
- Expected temperature based on time of day and season

#### Confidence Levels
Each fire detection includes a confidence percentage:
- **High (80-100%)**: Strong thermal signature, very likely an active fire
- **Medium (50-79%)**: Moderate thermal signature, likely fire but may need verification
- **Low (0-49%)**: Weak thermal signature, could be fire or other heat source

#### Factors Affecting Detection
- **Cloud Cover**: Clouds block thermal radiation, preventing detection
- **Fire Size**: Fires smaller than ~1000m¬≤ may not be detected
- **Fire Temperature**: Smoldering fires may be missed
- **Terrain**: Steep terrain can affect pixel size and detection accuracy
- **Sun Angle**: Detection algorithms adjust for solar heating effects

- **Time Delays**: 3-6 hour delay between fire occurrence and detection
- **False Positives**: Industrial heat sources, gas flares, volcanoes may trigger alerts
- **False Negatives**: Small, cool, or cloud-obscured fires may be missed

### Data Accuracy
- **Spatial Accuracy**: ¬±1km for MODIS, ¬±375m for VIIRS under ideal conditions
- **Temporal Accuracy**: Acquisition time accurate to within minutes
- **Confidence Levels**: Statistical probability, not absolute certainty

## üî¨ Scientific Background

### Fire Detection Science
Fire detection from space relies on the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Planck's law of blackbody radiation. Fires emit intense thermal radiation at specific wavelengths that can be distinguished from normal background temperatures.

### Algorithm Development
NASA's fire detection algorithms have been refined over decades of satellite observations and ground truth validation. The algorithms account for:
- Diurnal temperature cycles
- Seasonal variations
- Land cover types
- Atmospheric conditions

### Validation Studies
Fire detection accuracy is continuously validated through:
- Ground-based observations
- Aircraft overflights
- Comparison with other satellite systems
- Statistical analysis of detection rates

## üìà Future Developments

### Potential Enhancements
- Integration with additional satellite data sources
