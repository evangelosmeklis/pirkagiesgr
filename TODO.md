I want a website with a very cool map as the landing page. Use vibrant colors etc make it user friendly. 

I want the website to pull from this API from NASA the fires that are ongoing in Greece.

if you can read from this webpage the API endpoints. 

@https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/content/academy/data_api/firms_api_use.html 

display the live data on the website. Give information and accuracy alerts about the ongoing fires.
Keep a seperate tab were you would show historical fires we dont need to prompt the api for the historical fires just create an sqlite datbaase were we would store the fires that have stopped. 

I WANT YOU TO FOCUS AS MUCH ON THE UI AS POSSIBLE. Offer information when people hover or click on a certain fire. 
Also integrate with a free weather API if you can and show the weather that is currently going on on a site of the fire, and what it will be like in the next 24 hrs
